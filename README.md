**Project Description:**
This project implements a real-time vehicle counting system using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The system is designed to analyze video footage and detect vehicles, keeping track of their count as they cross a predefined line. The application is capable of handling various environmental conditions and provides visual feedback on the video stream, displaying the count in real-time.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to develop an efficient vehicle counting system for traffic monitoring and management. The system employs background subtraction, image processing techniques, and contour detection to identify vehicles in a video stream. By establishing a counting line, the system tracks vehicles crossing the line, updating the count dynamically.
